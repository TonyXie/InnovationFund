      %h3 Judging Criteria
      %p Initial grants are of $1,000 each. These grants are judged on the following criteria: 
      %ul 
        %li Projects must have an innovative factor: technological/process.
        %li Projects must have a technological component.
        %li Projects should have a good management team which is dedicated to implementation.
        %li Projects must be feasible.
        %li Projects must be in accordance with the Weiss Tech House ideals and mission.
        %li The innovative part of the project must be completed by the team and not outsourced.
      %p After the initial grant, teams can pitch once again for up to $4,000 in additional funding. These subsequent pitches are judged on the following criteria. 
      %ul 
        %li How has your team used the initial $1,000 grant?
        %li What milestones has your team been able to reach with the initial grant?

        %li Did your team stay in contact with your project manager and give him any project updates?
      %h3 Use of funds conditions:

        %li Server costs
